# Uncommon HTML Bug: Asynchronous DOM Manipulation

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to asynchronous script execution and potential issues when manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) in HTML.  The bug arises from a lack of robust error handling and consideration of timing in asynchronous operations. This can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when dealing with older browsers or complex DOM structures. The `bug.html` file showcases the problematic code, and `bugSolution.html` provides a refined, more reliable implementation.

## Bug Description:

The primary issue lies in the asynchronous nature of the JavaScript within `bug.html`. The script attempts to modify the content of a div element. However, without proper checks to ensure the div element exists before attempting modification, and without handling potential timing conflicts (as demonstrated by the `setTimeout`), the script's behavior might be inconsistent or produce errors.  Older browsers, in particular, may be less tolerant of these inconsistencies. 

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.html` file addresses this issue by adding error handling and explicitly checking the existence of the element before modification. It demonstrates a more robust method to avoid unexpected behavior.
